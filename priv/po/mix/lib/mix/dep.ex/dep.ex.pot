"    operations\n"
"\n"
"  * `app` - the application name as an atom\n"
"\n"
"  * `requirement` - a binary or regex with the dependency's requirement\n"
"\n"
"  * `status` - the current status of the dependency, check\n"
"    `Mix.Dep.format_status/1` for more info\n"
"\n"
"  * `opts` - the options given by the developer\n"
"\n"
"  * `deps` - dependencies of this dependency\n"
"\n"
"  * `top_level` - true if dependency was defined in the top-level project\n"

"    `:rebar` | `:rebar3` | `:mix` | `:make` | `nil`\n"

"  * `from` - path to the file where the dependency was defined\n"

"Furthermore, in the `opts` fields, Mix keeps some internal options, which\n"
"can be accessed by SCMs:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:app`   - the application name\n"
"  * `:dest`  - the destination path for the dependency\n"
"  * `:lock`  - the lock information retrieved from mix.lock\n"
