#. TRANSLATORS: def Mix.Dep.__struct__()
#: lib/mix/dep.ex:4
msgid ""
"The Mix.Dep struct keeps information about your project dependencies.\n"
"\n"
"It contains:\n"
"\n"
"  * `scm` - a module representing the source code management tool (SCM)\n"
"    operations\n"
"\n"
"  * `app` - the application name as an atom\n"
"\n"
"  * `requirement` - a binary or regex with the dependency's requirement\n"
"\n"
"  * `status` - the current status of the dependency, check\n"
"    `Mix.Dep.format_status/1` for more info\n"
"\n"
"  * `opts` - the options given by the developer\n"
"\n"
"  * `deps` - dependencies of this dependency\n"
"\n"
"  * `top_level` - true if dependency was defined in the top-level project\n"
"\n"
"  * `manager` - the project management, possible values:\n"
"    `:rebar` | `:rebar3` | `:mix` | `:make` | `nil`\n"
"\n"
"  * `from` - path to the file where the dependency was defined\n"
"\n"
"  * `extra` - a slot for adding extra configuration based on the manager;\n"
"    the information on this field is private to the manager and should not "
"be\n"
"    relied on\n"
"\n"
"A dependency is in two specific states: loaded and unloaded.\n"
"\n"
"When a dependency is unloaded, it means Mix only parsed its specification\n"
"and made no attempt to actually load the dependency or validate its\n"
"status. When the dependency is loaded, it means Mix attempted to fetch,\n"
"load and validate it, the status is set in the status field.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, in the `opts` fields, Mix keeps some internal options, which\n"
"can be accessed by SCMs:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:app`   - the application name\n"
"  * `:dest`  - the destination path for the dependency\n"
"  * `:lock`  - the lock information retrieved from mix.lock\n"
"  * `:build` - the build path for the dependency\n"
