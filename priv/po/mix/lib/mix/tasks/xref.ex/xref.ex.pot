"Performs cross reference checks between modules.\n"
"\n"
"## Xref modes\n"
"\n"
"The `xref` task expects a mode as first argument:\n"
"\n"
"    mix xref MODE\n"
"\n"
"All available modes are discussed below.\n"
"\n"
"### warnings\n"
"\n"
"Prints warnings for violated cross reference checks:\n"
"\n"
"    mix xref warnings\n"
"\n"
"This is the mode used by Mix during compilation.\n"
"\n"
"### unreachable\n"
"\n"
"Prints all unreachable \"file:line: module.function/arity\" entries:\n"
"\n"
"    mix xref unreachable\n"
"\n"
"The \"file:line\" represents the file and line a call to an unknown\n"
"\"module.function/arity\" is made.\n"
"\n"
"### callers CALLEE\n"
"\n"
"Prints all callers of the given `CALLEE`, which can be one of: `Module`,\n"
"`Module.function`, or `Module.function/arity`. Examples:\n"
"\n"
"    mix xref callers MyMod\n"
"    mix xref callers MyMod.fun\n"
"    mix xref callers MyMod.fun/3\n"
"\n"
"### graph\n"
"\n"
"Prints a file dependency graph where an edge from `A` to `B` indicates\n"
"that `A` depends on `B`.\n"
"\n"
"    mix xref graph --format dot\n"
"\n"
"The following options are accepted:\n"
"\n"
"  * `--exclude` - paths to exclude\n"
"\n"
"  * `--source` - displays all files that the given source file references (directly or indirectly)\n"
"\n"
"  * `--sink` - displays all files that reference the given file (directly or indirectly)\n"
"\n"
"  * `--format` - can be set to one of:\n"
"\n"
"    * `pretty` - uses Unicode codepoints for formatting the graph.\n"
"      This is the default except on Windows\n"
"\n"
"    * `plain` - does not use Unicode codepoints for formatting the graph.\n"
"      This is the default on Windows\n"
"\n"
"    * `dot` - produces a DOT graph description in `xref_graph.dot` in the\n"
"      current directory. Warning: this will override any previously generated file\n"
"\n"
"The `--source` and `--sink` options are particularly useful when trying to understand how\n"
"the modules in a particular file interact with the whole system.\n"
"\n"
"## Shared options\n"
"\n"
"Those options are shared across all modes:\n"
"\n"
"  * `--no-compile` - does not compile even if files require compilation\n"
"\n"
"  * `--no-deps-check` - does not check dependencies\n"
"\n"
"  * `--no-archives-check` - does not check archives\n"
"\n"
"  * `--no-elixir-version-check` - does not check the Elixir version from mix.exs\n"
"\n"
"## Configuration\n"
"\n"
"All configuration for Xref should be placed under the key `:xref`.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:exclude` - a list of modules and `{module, function, arity}` tuples to ignore when checking\n"
"    cross references. For example: `[MissingModule, {MissingModule2, :missing_func, 2}]`\n"
