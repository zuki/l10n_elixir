"Builds an archive according to the specification of the\n"
"[Erlang Archive Format](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/code.html).\n"
"\n"
"Archives are meant to contain small projects, usually installed\n"
"locally. Archives may be installed into a Mix environment by\n"
"running `mix archive.install`. Once installed, the archive is\n"
"available to all Mix projects. For this reason, the functionality\n"
"behind archives is limited. For instance, archives do not include\n"
"dependencies, as those would conflict with any dependency in a\n"
"Mix project after the archive is installed. In general, we recommend\n"
"the usage of archives to be limited for extensions of Mix, such\n"
"as custom SCMs, package managers, etc. For general scripts to be\n"
"installed into machines, please see `mix escript.build`.\n"
"\n"
"The archive will be created in the current directory (which is\n"
"expected to be the project root), unless an argument `-o` is\n"
"provided with the file name.\n"
"\n"
"By default, this command archives the current project but the `-i`\n"
"option can be used to archive any directory. For example,\n"
"`mix archive.build` with no options translates to:\n"
"\n"
"    mix archive.build -i _build/ENV/lib/APP -o APP-VERSION.ez\n"
"\n"
"## Command line options\n"
"\n"
"  * `-o` - specifies output file name.\n"
"    If there is a `mix.exs`, defaults to \"APP-VERSION.ez\".\n"
"\n"
"  * `-i` - specifies the input directory to archive.\n"
"    If there is a `mix.exs`, defaults to the current application build.\n"
"\n"
"  * `--no-compile` - skips compilation.\n"
"    Only applies when `mix.exs` is available.\n"
