"When this task runs, it will check the modification time of every file, and\n"
"if it has changed, the file will be compiled. Files will be\n"
"compiled in the same source directory with a .erl extension.\n"
"You can force compilation regardless of modification times by passing\n"
"the `--force` option.\n"

"## Command line options\n"

"  * `--force` - forces compilation regardless of modification times\n"

"## Configuration\n"
"\n"
"  * `:erlc_paths` - directories to find source files. Defaults to `[\"src"
"\"]`.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:leex_options` - compilation options that apply\n"

"options\n"
"    are overridden by this compiler, thus setting them has no effect.\n"
