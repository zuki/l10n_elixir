"When this task runs, it will first check the modification times of\n"
"all files to be compiled and if they haven't been\n"
"changed since the last compilation, it will not compile\n"
"them. If any of them have changed, it compiles\n"
"everything.\n"

"For this reason, the task touches your `:compile_path`\n"

"  * `ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS` - can be used to give default compile options.\n"
"    The value must be a valid Erlang term. If the value is a list, it will\n"
