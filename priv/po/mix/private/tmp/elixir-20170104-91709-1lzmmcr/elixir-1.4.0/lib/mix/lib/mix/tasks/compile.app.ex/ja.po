"Writes an .app file.\n"
"\n"
"An `.app` file is a file containing Erlang terms that defines\n"
"your application. Mix automatically generates this file based on\n"
"your `mix.exs` configuration. You can learn more about OTP\n"
"applications by seeing the documentation for the `Application`\n"
"module.\n"
"\n"
"In order to generate the `.app` file, Mix expects your application\n"
"to have both `:app` and `:version` keys. Furthermore, you can\n"
"configure the generated application by defining an `application/0`\n"
"function in your `mix.exs` with the following options:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:applications` - all applications your application depends\n"
"    on at runtime. By default, this list is automatically inferred\n"
"    from your dependencies. Any extra Erlang/Elixir dependency\n"
"    must be specified in `:extra_applications`. Mix and other tools\n"
"    use the application list in order to start your dependencies\n"
"    before starting the application itself.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:extra_applications` - a list of Erlang/Elixir applications\n"
"    that you want started before your application. For example,\n"
"    Elixir's `:logger` or Erlang's `:crypto`.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:registered` - the name of all registered processes in the\n"
"    application. If your application defines a local GenServer\n"
"    with name `MyServer`, it is recommended to add `MyServer`\n"
"    to this list. It is most useful in detecting conflicts\n"
"    between applications that register the same names.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:mod` - specifies a module to invoke when the application\n"
"    is started. It must be in the format `{Mod, args}` where\n"
"    args is often an empty list. The module specified must\n"
"    implement the callbacks defined by the `Application`\n"
"    module.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:env` - default values for the application environment.\n"
"    The application environment is one of the most common ways\n"
"    to configure applications.\n"
"\n"
"Let's see an example `application/0` function:\n"
"\n"
"    def application do\n"
"      [mod: {MyApp, []},\n"
"       env: [default: :value],\n"
"       applications: [:crypto]]\n"
"    end\n"
"\n"
"Besides the options above, `.app` files also expect other\n"
"options like `:modules` and `:vsn`, but these are automatically\n"
"added by Mix.\n"
"\n"
"## Command line options\n"
"\n"
"  * `--force` - forces compilation regardless of modification times\n"
"\n"
