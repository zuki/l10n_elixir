To ensure examples do not get out of date, Elixir's test framework (ExUnit) provides a feature called doctests that allows developers to test the examples in their documentation. Doctests work by parsing out code samples starting with `iex>` from the documentation. You can read more about it at `ExUnit.DocTest`."

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:92

Not only that, if `MyApp.Sample` is imported, the `add/2` function will also be imported into the caller. For those reasons, be cautious when adding `@doc false` to functions, instead use one of these two options:"

"Elixir stores documentation inside pre-defined chunks in the bytecode. It can be accessed from Elixir by using the `Code.get_docs/2` function. This also means documentation is only accessed when required and not when modules are loaded by the Virtual Machine. The only downside is that modules defined in-memory, like the ones defined in IEx, cannot have their documentation accessed as they do not have their bytecode written to disk.\n"
