"Defines a range.\n"
"\n"
"A range represents a discrete number of values where\n"
"the first and last values are integers.\n"
"\n"
"Ranges can be either increasing (first <= last) or\n"
"decreasing (first > last). Ranges are also always\n"
"inclusive.\n"
"\n"
"A Range is represented internally as a struct. However,\n"
"the most common form of creating and matching on ranges\n"
"is via the `../2` macro, auto-imported from `Kernel`:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> range = 1..3\n"
"    1..3\n"
"    iex> first..last = range\n"
"    iex> first\n"
"    1\n"
"    iex> last\n"
"    3\n"
"\n"
"A Range implements the Enumerable protocol, which means\n"
"all of the functions in the Enum module is available:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> range = 1..10\n"
"    1..10\n"
"    iex> Enum.reduce(range, 0, fn i, acc -> i * i + acc end)\n"
"    385\n"
"    iex> Enum.count(range)\n"
"    10\n"
"    iex> Enum.member?(range, 11)\n"
"    false\n"
"    iex> Enum.member?(range, 8)\n"
"    true\n"
