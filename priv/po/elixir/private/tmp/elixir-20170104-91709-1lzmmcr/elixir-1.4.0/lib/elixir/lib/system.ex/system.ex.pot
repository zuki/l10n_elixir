"\n"
"The `System` module also provides functions that work with time,\n"
"returning different times kept by the system with support for\n"
"different time units.\n"
"\n"
"One of the complexities in relying on system times is that they\n"
"may be adjusted. For example, when you enter and leave daylight\n"
"saving time, the system clock will be adjusted, often adding\n"
"or removing one hour. We call such changes \"time warps\". In\n"
"order to understand how such changes may be harmful, imagine\n"
"the following code:\n"
"\n"
"    ## DO NOT DO THIS\n"
"    prev = System.os_time()\n"
"    # ... execute some code ...\n"
"    next = System.os_time()\n"
"    diff = next - prev\n"
"\n"
"If, while the code is executing, the system clock changes,\n"
"some code that executed in 1 second may be reported as taking\n"
"over 1 hour! To address such concerns, the VM provides a\n"
"monotonic time via `System.monotonic_time/0` which never\n"
"decreases and does not leap:\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"  * `os_time/0` - the time reported by the OS. This time may be\n"
"    adjusted forwards or backwards in time with no limitation;\n"
"\n"
"  * `system_time/0` - the VM view of the `os_time/0`. The system time and OS\n"
"    time may not match in case of time warps although the VM works towards\n"
"    aligning them. This time is not monotonic (i.e., it may decrease)\n"

"    mode](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#Time_Warp_Modes);\n"
"\n"
"  * `monotonic_time/0` - a monotonically increasing time provided\n"
"    by the Erlang VM.\n"
"\n"
"The time functions in this module work in the `:native` unit\n"
"(unless specified otherwise), which is OS dependent. Most of\n"
