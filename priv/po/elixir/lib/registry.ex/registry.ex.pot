"A local, decentralized and scalable key-value process storage.\n"

"implementation. We explore some of those use cases below.\n"
"\n"
"The registry may also be transparently partitioned, which provides\n"
"more scalable behaviour for running registries on highly concurrent\n"
"environments with thousands or millions of entries.\n"
"\n"
"## Using in `:via`\n"
"\n"
"Once the registry is started with a given name (using\n"

"Only registries with unique keys can be used in `:via`. If the name is\n"
"already taken, the case-specific `start_link` function (`Agent.start_link/2`\n"
"in the example above) will return `{:error, {:already_started, current_pid}}`.\n"
"\n"
"## Using as a dispatcher\n"
"\n"
"`Registry` has a dispatch mechanism that allows developers to implement custom\n"
"dispatch logic triggered from the caller. For example, let's say we have a\n"
"duplicate registry started as so:\n"
"\n"
"    {:ok, _} = Registry.start_link(:duplicate, Registry.DispatcherTest)\n"
"\n"
"By calling `register/3`, different processes can register under a given key\n"
"and associate any value under that key. In this case, let's register the\n"
"current process under the key `\"hello\"` and attach the `{IO, :inspect}` tuple\n"
"to it:\n"
"\n"
"    {:ok, _} = Registry.register(Registry.DispatcherTest, \"hello\", {IO, :inspect})\n"
"\n"
"Now, an entity interested in dispatching events for a given key may call\n"
"`dispatch/3` passing in the key and a callback. This callback will be invoked\n"
"with a list of all the values registered under the requested key, alongside\n"
"the pid of the process that registered each value, in the form of `{pid,\n"
"value}` tuples. In our example, `value` will be the `{module, function}` tuple\n"
"in the code above:\n"
"\n"
"    Registry.dispatch(Registry.DispatcherTest, \"hello\", fn entries ->\n"
"      for {pid, {module, function}} <- entries, do: apply(module, function, [pid])\n"
"    end)\n"
"    # Prints #PID<...> where the pid is for the process that called register/3 above\n"
"    #=> :ok\n"
"\n"
"Dispatching happens in the process that calls `dispatch/3` either serially or\n"
"concurrently in case of multiple partitions (via spawned tasks). The\n"
"registered processes are not involved in dispatching unless involving them is\n"
"done explicitly (for example, by sending them a message in the callback).\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, if there is a failure when dispatching, due to a bad\n"
"registration, dispatching will always fail and the registered process will not\n"
"be notified. Therefore let's make sure we at least wrap and report those\n"
"errors:\n"
"\n"
"    require Logger\n"
"    Registry.dispatch(Registry.DispatcherTest, \"hello\", fn entries ->\n"
"      for {pid, {module, function}} <- entries do\n"
"        try do\n"
"          apply(module, function, [pid])\n"
"        catch\n"
"          kind, reason ->\n"
"            formatted = Exception.format(kind, reason, System.stacktrace)\n"
"            Logger.error \"Registry.dispatch/3 failed with #{formatted}\"\n"
"        end\n"
"      end\n"
"    end)\n"
"    # Prints #PID<...>\n"
"    #=> :ok\n"
"\n"
"You could also replace the whole `apply` system by explicitly sending\n"
"messages. That's the example we will see next.\n"
"\n"
"## Using as a PubSub\n"
"\n"
"Registries can also be used to implement a local, non-distributed, scalable\n"
"PubSub by relying on the `dispatch/3` function, similarly to the previous\n"
"section: in this case, however, we will send messages to each associated\n"
"process, instead of invoking a given module-function.\n"
"\n"
"In this example, we will also set the number of partitions to the number of\n"
"schedulers online, which will make the registry more performant on highly\n"
"concurrent environments as each partition will spawn a new process, allowing\n"
"dispatching to happen in parallel:\n"
"\n"
"    {:ok, _} = Registry.start_link(:duplicate, Registry.PubSubTest,\n"
"                                   partitions: System.schedulers_online)\n"
"    {:ok, _} = Registry.register(Registry.PubSubTest, \"hello\", [])\n"
"    Registry.dispatch(Registry.PubSubTest, \"hello\", fn entries ->\n"
"      for {pid, _} <- entries, do: send(pid, {:broadcast, \"world\"})\n"
"    end)\n"
"    #=> :ok\n"
"\n"
"The example above broadcasted the message `{:broadcast, \"world\"}` to all\n"
"processes registered under the \"topic\" (or \"key\" as we called it until now)\n"
"`\"hello\"`.\n"
"\n"
"The third argument given to `register/3` is a value associated to the\n"
"current process. While in the previous section we used it when dispatching,\n"
"in this particular example we are not interested in it, so we have set it\n"
"to an empty list. You could store a more meaningful value if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"## Registrations\n"
"\n"
"Looking up, dispatching and registering are efficient and immediate at\n"
"the cost of delayed unsubscription. For example, if a process crashes,\n"
"its keys are automatically removed from the registry but the change may\n"
"not propagate immediately. This means certain operations may return processes\n"
"that are already dead. When such may happen, it will be explicitly stated\n"
"in the function documentation.\n"
"\n"
"However, keep in mind those cases are typically not an issue. After all, a\n"
"process referenced by a pid may crash at any time, including between getting\n"
"the value from the registry and sending it a message. Many parts of the standard\n"
"library are designed to cope with that, such as `Process.monitor/1` which will\n"
"deliver the `:DOWN` message immediately if the monitored process is already dead\n"
"and `Kernel.send/2` which acts as a no-op for dead processes.\n"
