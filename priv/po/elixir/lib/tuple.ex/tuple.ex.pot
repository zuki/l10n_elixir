"Functions for working with tuples.\n"
"\n"
"Tuples are ordered collection of elements; tuples can contain elements of any\n"
"type, and a tuple can contain elements of different types. Curly braces can be\n"
"used to create tuples:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> {}\n"
"    {}\n"
"    iex> {1, :two, \"three\"}\n"
"    {1, :two, \"three\"}\n"
"\n"
"Tuples store elements contiguously in memory; this means that accessing a\n"
"tuple element by index (which can be done through the `Kernel.elem/2`\n"
"function) is a constant-time operation:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> tuple = {1, :two, \"three\"}\n"
"    iex> elem(tuple, 0)\n"
"    1\n"
"    iex> elem(tuple, 2)\n"
"    \"three\"\n"
"\n"
"Same goes for getting the tuple size (via `Kernel.tuple_size/1`):\n"
"\n"
"    iex> tuple_size({})\n"
"    0\n"
"    iex> tuple_size({1, 2, 3})\n"
"    3\n"
"\n"
"Tuples being stored contiguously in memory also means that updating a tuple\n"
"(for example replacing an element with `Kernel.put_elem/3`) will make a copy\n"
"of the whole tuple.\n"
"\n"
"Tuples are not meant to be used as a \"collection\" type (which is also\n"
"suggested by the absence of an implementation of the `Enumerable` protocol for\n"
"tuples): they're mostly meant to be used as a fixed-size container for\n"
"multiple elements. For example, tuples are often used to have functions return\n"
"\"enriched\" values: a common pattern is for functions to return `{:ok, value}`\n"
"for successful cases and `{:error, reason}` for unsuccessful cases. For\n"
"example, this is exactly what `File.read/1` does: it returns `{:ok, contents}`\n"
"if reading the given file is successful, or `{:error, reason}` otherwise\n"
"(e.g., `{:error, :enoent}` if the file doesn't exist).\n"
"\n"
"This module provides functions to work with tuples; some more functions to\n"
"work with tuples can be found in `Kernel` (`Kernel.tuple_size/1`,\n"
"`Kernel.elem/2`, `Kernel.put_elem/3`, and others).\n"
