"Those files are compiled in parallel and can automatically\n"
"detect dependencies between them. Once a dependency is found,\n"

"This function accepts the following options:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:each_file` - for each file compiled, invokes the callback passing the\n"
"    file\n"

"  * `:each_long_compilation` - for each file that takes more than a given\n"
"    timeout (see the `:long_compilation_threshold` option) to compile, invoke\n"

"  * `:long_compilation_threshold` - the timeout (in seconds) after the\n"
"    `:each_long_compilation` callback is invoked; defaults to `10`\n"
"\n"
"  * `:each_module` - for each module compiled, invokes the callback passing\n"
"    the file, module and the module bytecode\n"
"\n"
"  * `:dest` - the destination directory for the BEAM files. When using `files/2`,\n"
"    this information is only used to properly annotate the BEAM files before\n"
"    they are loaded into memory. If you want a file to actually be written to\n"
