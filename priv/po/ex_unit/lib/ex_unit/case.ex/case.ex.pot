"Sets up an ExUnit test case.\n"
"\n"
"This module must be used in other modules as a way to configure\n"
"and prepare them for testing.\n"
"\n"
"When used, it accepts the following options:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:async` - configure this specific test case to able to run in parallel\n"
"    with other test cases. May be used for performance when this test case\n"
"    does not change any global state. Defaults to `false`.\n"
"\n"
"This module automatically includes all callbacks defined in\n"
"`ExUnit.Callbacks`. See that module's documentation for more\n"
"information.\n"
"\n"
"## Examples\n"
"\n"
"     defmodule AssertionTest do\n"
"       # Use the module\n"
"       use ExUnit.Case, async: true\n"
"\n"

"       test \"always pass\" do\n"
"         assert true\n"
"       end\n"
"     end\n"
"\n"
"## Context\n"
"\n"
"All tests receive a context as an argument. The context is particularly\n"
"useful for sharing information between callbacks and tests:\n"
"\n"
"    defmodule KVTest do\n"
"      use ExUnit.Case\n"
"\n"
"      setup do\n"
"        {:ok, pid} = KV.start_link\n"
"        {:ok, [pid: pid]}\n"
"      end\n"
"\n"
"      test \"stores key-value pairs\", context do\n"
"        assert KV.put(context[:pid], :hello, :world) == :ok\n"
"        assert KV.get(context[:pid], :hello) == :world\n"
"      end\n"
"    end\n"
"\n"
"As the context is a map, it can be pattern matched on to extract\n"
"information:\n"
"\n"
"    test \"stores key-value pairs\", %{pid: pid} do\n"
"      assert KV.put(pid, :hello, :world) == :ok\n"
"      assert KV.get(pid, :hello) == :world\n"
"    end\n"
"\n"
"## Tags\n"
"\n"
"The context is used to pass information from the callbacks to\n"
"the test. In order to pass information from the test to the\n"
"callback, ExUnit provides tags.\n"
"\n"
"By tagging a test, the tag value can be accessed in the context,\n"
"allowing the developer to customize the test. Let's see an\n"
"example:\n"
"\n"
"    defmodule FileTest do\n"
"      # Changing directory cannot be async\n"
"      use ExUnit.Case, async: false\n"
"\n"
"      setup context do\n"
"        # Read the :cd tag value\n"
"        if cd = context[:cd] do\n"
"          prev_cd = File.cwd!\n"
"          File.cd!(cd)\n"
"          on_exit fn -> File.cd!(prev_cd) end\n"
"        end\n"
"\n"
"        :ok\n"
"      end\n"
"\n"
"      @tag cd: \"fixtures\"\n"
"      test \"reads UTF-8 fixtures\" do\n"
"        File.read(\"hello\")\n"
"      end\n"
"    end\n"
"\n"
"In the example above, we have defined a tag called `:cd` that is\n"
"read in the setup callback to configure the working directory the\n"
"test is going to run on.\n"
"\n"
"Tags are also very effective when used with case templates\n"
"(`ExUnit.CaseTemplate`) allowing callbacks in the case template\n"
"to customize the test behaviour.\n"
"\n"
"Note a tag can be set in two different ways:\n"
"\n"
"    @tag key: value\n"
"    @tag :key       # equivalent to setting @tag key: true\n"
"\n"
"If a tag is given more than once, the last value wins.\n"
"\n"
"### Module tags\n"
"\n"
"A tag can be set for all tests in a module by setting `@moduletag`:\n"
"\n"
"    @moduletag :external\n"
"\n"
"If the same key is set via `@tag`, the `@tag` value has higher\n"
"precedence.\n"
"\n"
"### Known tags\n"
"\n"
"The following tags are set automatically by ExUnit and are\n"
"therefore reserved:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:case`       - the test case module\n"
"  * `:file`       - the file on which the test was defined\n"
"  * `:line`       - the line on which the test was defined\n"
"  * `:test`       - the test name\n"
"  * `:async`      - if the test case is in async mode\n"
"  * `:type`       - the type of the test (`:test`, `:property`, etc)\n"
"  * `:registered` - used for `ExUnit.Case.register_attribute/3` values\n"
"  * `:describe`   - the describe block the test belongs to\n"
"\n"
"The following tags customize how tests behaves:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:capture_log` - see the \"Log Capture\" section below\n"
"  * `:skip` - skips the test with the given reason\n"
"  * `:timeout` - customizes the test timeout in milliseconds (defaults to 60000)\n"
"  * `:report` - includes the given tags and context keys on error reports,\n"
"    see the \"Reporting tags\" section\n"
"\n"
"### Reporting tags\n"
"\n"
"ExUnit also allows tags or any other key in your context to be included\n"
"in error reports, making it easy for developers to see under which circumstances\n"
"a test was evaluated. To do so, you use the `:report` tag:\n"
"\n"
"    @moduletag report: [:user_id]\n"
"\n"
"## Filters\n"
"\n"
"Tags can also be used to identify specific tests, which can then\n"
"be included or excluded using filters. The most common functionality\n"
"is to exclude some particular tests from running, which can be done\n"
"via `ExUnit.configure/1`:\n"
"\n"
"    # Exclude all external tests from running\n"
"    ExUnit.configure(exclude: [external: true])\n"
"\n"
"From now on, ExUnit will not run any test that has the `external` flag\n"
"set to `true`. This behaviour can be reversed with the `:include` option\n"
"which is usually passed through the command line:\n"
"\n"
"    mix test --include external:true\n"
"\n"
"Run `mix help test` for more information on how to run filters via Mix.\n"
"\n"
"Another use case for tags and filters is to exclude all tests that have\n"
"a particular tag by default, regardless of its value, and include only\n"
"a certain subset:\n"
"\n"
"    ExUnit.configure(exclude: :os, include: [os: :unix])\n"
"\n"
"Keep in mind that all tests are included by default, so unless they are\n"
"excluded first, the `include` option has no effect.\n"
"\n"
"## Log Capture\n"
"\n"
"ExUnit can optionally suppress printing of log messages that are generated during a test. Log\n"
"messages generated while running a test are captured and only if the test fails are they printed\n"
"to aid with debugging.\n"
"\n"
"You can opt into this behaviour for individual tests by tagging them with `:capture_log` or enable\n"
"log capture for all tests in the ExUnit configuration:\n"
"\n"
"    ExUnit.start(capture_log: true)\n"
"\n"
"This default can be overridden by `@tag capture_log: false` or `@moduletag capture_log: false`.\n"
"\n"
"Since `setup_all` blocks don't belong to a specific test, log messages generated in them (or\n"
"between tests) are never captured. If you want to suppress these messages as well, remove the\n"
"console backend globally:\n"
"\n"
"    config :logger, backends: []\n"
