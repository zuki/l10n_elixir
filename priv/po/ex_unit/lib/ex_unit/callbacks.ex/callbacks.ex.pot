#. TRANSLATORS: Elixir.ExUnit.Callbacks Summary
#: lib/ex_unit/callbacks.ex:2 
msgid ""
"Defines ExUnit callbacks.\n"
"\n"
"This module defines both `setup_all` and `setup` callbacks, as well as\n"
"the `on_exit/2` facility.\n"
"\n"
"The setup callbacks are defined via macros and each one can optionally\n"
"receive a map with metadata, usually referred to as `context`. The\n"
"callback may optionally put extra data into `context` to be used in\n"
"the tests.\n"
"\n"
"The `setup_all` callbacks are invoked once to setup the test case before any\n"
"test is run and all `setup` callbacks are run before each test. No callback\n"
"runs if the test case has no tests or all tests have been filtered out.\n"
"\n"
"`on_exit/2` callbacks are registered on demand, usually to undo an action\n"
"performed by a setup callback. `on_exit/2` may also take a reference,\n"
"allowing callback to be overridden in the future. A registered `on_exit/2`\n"
"callback always runs, while failures in `setup` and `setup_all` will stop\n"
"all remaining setup callbacks from executing.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, `setup_all` callbacks run in the test case process, while all\n"
"`setup` callbacks run in the same process as the test itself. `on_exit/2`\n"
"callbacks always run in a separate process than the test case or the\n"
"test itself. Since the test process exits with reason `:shutdown`, most\n"
"of times `on_exit/2` can be avoided as processes are going to clean\n"
"up on their own.\n"
"\n"
"## Context\n"
"\n"
"If you return `{:ok, keywords}` from `setup_all`, the keyword\n"
"will be merged into the current context and be available in all\n"
"subsequent `setup_all`, `setup` and the test itself.\n"
"\n"
"Similarly, returning `{:ok, keywords}` from `setup`, the keyword\n"
"returned will be merged into the current context and be available\n"
"in all subsequent `setup` and the `test` itself.\n"
"\n"
"Returning `:ok` leaves the context unchanged in both cases.\n"
"\n"
"Returning anything else from `setup_all` will force all tests to fail,\n"
"while a bad response from `setup` causes the current test to fail.\n"
"\n"
